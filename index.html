                    </header>
                    <p>One of the main goals of our workshop is to bridge the gap between Computational Cognitive &
                        Behavior Science, Explainable AI, Transportation, and the Autonomous Driving community.
                        Our SIAM workshop mainly targets theoretical frameworks and practical algorithms of perception,
                        decision-making, and planning integrated with social factors and computational cognitive science
                        to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to interact with human agents in a socially compatible way.
                        Specifically, the topics are as follows, but not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Applications of AVs interacting with human agents;</li>

                        <li>Evaluation and quantification of inter-human interactions and their implementations to
                            human-AV interactions;

                            <td class='expanded-row-content hide-row'>Abstract: For all its hype, autonomous vehicles
                                have yet to make our roadways more sustainable: safer, cheaper, cleaner. This talk
                                suggests that key to unlocking sustainable roadways is to shift the focus from
                                autonomy-driven design to use-driven design. Based on recent work, the talk focuses on
                                three critical priorities––safety, cost, and environment––each leveraging the 'autonomy'
                                capability of coordinating vehicles. But fully autonomous agents are not the only
                                entities that can coordinate. A paragon of safety is air traffic control, in which
                                expert operators remotely coordinate aircraft. The work brings these ideas to the dense
                                traffic on roadways and analyzes the scalability of operators. Another much cheaper way
                                to coordinate is to give a smartphone app to drivers. The work characterizes how well
                                lower-tech systems can still achieve autonomous capabilities. For cleaner roadways,
                                dozens of articles have considered coordinating vehicles to reduce emissions. This work
                                models whether doing so would move the needle on climate change mitigation goals. To
                                study these multi-agent coordination problems, the work leverages queueing theory,
                                Lyapunov stability analysis, transfer learning, and multi-task reinforcement learning.
                                The talk will also substantiate issues of robustness that arise when applying
                                learning-based techniques and a new line of work designed to address them. Overall, the
                                results indicate promise for intelligent coordination to enable sustainable roadways.

                                (1) A generic framework for parameter tuning for different use cases.
                                (2) A scalable framework that can use a large amount of scenes to do the auto-tuning and
                                validation. (3) A modularized architecture. (4) A user-friendly end-to-end interface for
                                experiments, visualization, and analysis.

                                mostly achieved by including models of human driving behavior in autonomous vehicles.
                                These models can predict the future actions of human traffic participants, and based on
                                this information, the autonomous vehicle can better handle interactions in traffic.
                                However, many of these approaches are based on the concept of Game Theory and therefore
                                make strong assumptions about human behavior. For example, the assumptions that humans
                                are rational, and do not communicate. In this talk, I will present an alternative
                                approach to modeling human behavior in traffic interactions. We will discuss how
                                perceived risk is a driving factor behind human behavior in non-interactive scenarios,
                                and how communication plays an important role in interactions. Combined with Simon’s
                                ideas of bounded rationality and satisficing, these concepts led to our novel modeling
                                approach: the communication-enabled interaction model.

                            Cathy Wu is an Assistant Professor at MIT in LIDS, CEE, and IDSS. She holds a Ph.D. from
                            UC Berkeley, and B.S. and M.Eng. from MIT, all in EECS, and completed a Postdoc at
                            Microsoft Research. Her research interests are at the intersection of machine learning,
                            decision making, and mobility. Her current work focuses on how learning-based methods
                            can advance emerging mobility systems by better coping with the complexity of decisions
                            and control. She is broadly interested in enabling policy-relevant research by pushing
                            the boundaries of learning, control, and optimization. Cathy has received a number of
                            awards, including the NSF CAREER, dissertation awards, and publications with
                            distinctions. Her work has appeared in the press, including NOVA, Wired, Science
                            Magazine, the MIT Homepage, and TEDxMIT.

                            Olger Siebinga is a PhD candidate at Delft University of Technology, working in the field of
                            human-robot interaction. With a background in mechanical engineering, he has always been
                            fascinated by the combination of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. But
                            throwing humans in the mix is what makes things really interesting. Many robots can behave
                            safe and optimal in their own perfect, isolated world. But to make modern robots, such as
                            automated vehicles, function in the real world, they must be able to interact with humans in
                            a safe and natural manner. This is where his current work focuses on: understanding human
                            (driving) behavior and describing it in a mathematical way such that automated vehicles can
                            make decisions based on their understanding of humans.
